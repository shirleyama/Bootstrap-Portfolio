# Bootstrap-Portfolio
A portfolio using Bootstrap

## Description 
This is my original portfolio recreated in Bootstrap for the Bootcamp Unit 3 Challenge. It showcases my skills and talents to potential employers. Looking at it in a browser, it would seem almost identical to the original, yet et it uses a completely different framework, which should make it respond much better in other devices with minimal use of media queries.

## Tests

Tested in mobile and iPad viewports to see how it responds in these.

It would be great to test the website with the Mac screenreader VoiceOver to see how the website would appear to a visually impaired person, and whether it can be improved even further.
